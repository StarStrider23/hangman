# Hangman

This is a simple version of the game "Hangman". The file "hangman.py" contains the game itself and it was written utilising object-oriented programming (OOP). Pressing the Run button, the game will automatically choose a random word from the .txt file "words.txt" which contains 66,287 words. The file itself was downloaded from https://public.websites.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html. However, some of the words contained other characters such as "-", ".", "/" etc., which is why the file was filtered and these words were removed. Once the word is chosen, the game begins and the player is asked to enter a letter which he/she thinks is in the word. Alternatively, the player may enter a special character, "*", after which he/she can try to guess the entire word. The program also shows the game's progress by printing hangman (a different art depending on how many mistakes the player has made), letters that were used and a hint (number of letters in the word and the ones that were guessed). The game continues until the player either guesses the word or commits 7 mistakes. Regardless of the outcome, the player is asked if he/she would like to play again.
